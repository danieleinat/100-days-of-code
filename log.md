# ðŸ§  #100DaysOfCode Log

A daily journal documenting my progress as I commit to learning and growing as a developer for 100 days.

## ðŸ“… Day 1 â€“ May 9, 2025

### âœ… What I Did Today:
- Started the **#100DaysOfCode** challenge! ðŸŽ‰
- Completed the **"Cat Photo App"** project on freeCodeCamp.
- Practiced basic HTML tags including:
  - Headings: `<h1>`
  - Paragraphs: `<p>`
  - Links: `<a>`
  - Images: `<img>`
  - Lists: `<ul>`, `<li>`

### ðŸ¤” Challenges / Thoughts:
- I felt excited but also a little overwhelmed at the start.
- Figuring out how to structure elements like lists and images took some trial and error.

### ðŸ¤” Challenges / Thoughts:

- GitHub was completely new â€” I accidentally created two branches but figured out how to clean it up.
- Learning Markdown and Git terminology was a bit overwhelming, but also exciting.
